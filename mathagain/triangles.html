Do not restrict the order of the values (e.g., the longest first)  Validate that the lengths entered form a triangle; Otherwise, alert user to change the inputs, rejecting the inputs.  If the input lengths form a triangle, draw the triangle with the following instruction: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_polygon.asp   Use big letters to inform the user: That is a "SCALENE" or "EQUILATERAL" or "ISOSCELES" or "RIGHT" triangle.
